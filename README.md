# Winning Jeopardy
Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.

In this notebook, I work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out how helpful it is for show contestants to study past questions

The dataset is named `jeopardy.csv`, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can download [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file). 

The notebook is based on a guided project from Dataquest, an online Data Science bootcamp. The learning goal of the project was to test understanding of statistical significance and chai squared tests.
